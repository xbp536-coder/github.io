     <!-- Now / Goals section -->
  <section id="now">
    <h2>What I am working on now</h2>
    <p>
      Right now I am learning SQL for working with databases and practising Java programming
      to strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next year I aim to build small web applications that connect a web front end
      to a real database, so I can practise full-stack development and data handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am particularly interested in roles and projects related to web development and data engineering,
      where I can design efficient systems and work with real-world datasets.

      <h3>What is a CPU cache? (short explanation)</h3>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
      <p>
        A CPU cache is a small, very fast type of memory inside the processor. 
        It stores copies of data that the CPU uses often, so the CPU does not
        have to wait for slower main memory (RAM). This makes programs run faster.

      <h3>Intro to normalisation in databases</h3>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
      <p>
        Normalisation is the process of organising tables in a database so that 
        each table focuses on one topic and there is minimal duplicated data.
        This helps keep the data consistent and easier to maintain.
      </p>
    </article>
 
    <p>
      I use this section to write short explanations of ideas from computer architecture,
      databases, and other modules, so I remember them and can show my understanding.

  <h2>Production diary – Week 15</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 14 February 2026</p>
  <p>
    This week I have started to create an online protfolio.
    I focused on creating main sections and improving my CS Maths&Tools page.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am most happy with the CS Maths&Tools page. 
  </p>
  <p>
   I didn’t face any major difficulties with the things I learned this week.
  </p>
  <p>
    This week, I learned how to edit a website and add a new page to my portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next time I want to improve my project sections and rewrite my goals section.
